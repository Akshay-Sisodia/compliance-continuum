# Product Requirements Document: Compliance Continuum — MCP Server for Regulatory and Code Quality

## 1. Introduction

### Overview
The **Compliance Continuum — MCP Server** is a software solution designed to automate regulatory compliance and enforce code quality in software development projects. Built to be compliant with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by Anthropic, it targets organizations that must adhere to standards such as GDPR. Key features include auto-generated audit trails, real-time compliance verification, regulatory change alerts, and an Ethical AI Enforcer to block policy-violating code. The server integrates with tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, an MCP-optimized CVE database, and Zencoder's refactoring pipeline to streamline compliance processes, aiming to reduce audit costs by 60% and mitigate 92% of privacy risks through real-time checks.

### Purpose
This PRD defines the requirements for developing the Compliance Continuum — MCP Server, providing a clear roadmap for the development team to create a product that meets the needs of developers, compliance officers, and project managers while adhering to MCP standards.

### Goals
- **Reduce audit costs by 60%** through automation of compliance processes
- **Mitigate 92% of privacy risks** via real-time compliance verification
- **Achieve 99.9% uptime** for continuous compliance monitoring
- **Process compliance checks within 1 second** for optimal developer experience
