ml_analysis.py

This module provides machine learning-based code analysis, such as code quality or vulnerability detection. 

- Replace the mock implementation with real ML model inference for production use.
- Useful for advanced risk scoring or anomaly detection in code review pipelines.

    Analyze the given code using a machine learning model and return a dictionary of risk scores.

    Args:
        code (str): The code to analyze.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, float]: Dictionary of risk scores and confidence values.

        - Replace the mock implementation with actual ML model inference in production.
        - The keys/values in the dictionary should match your ML model's output.
