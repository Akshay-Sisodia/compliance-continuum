# Compliance & Audit Documentation

## System Overview
This document describes the compliance, security, and audit features of the Compliance Continuum MCP Server.

---

## Architecture & Security Controls
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, with role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Authorization:** Admin/user roles, endpoint protection, and permission checks.
- **Data Security:** Passwords are hashed; secrets are loaded from environment variables.
- **API Security:** All endpoints validate input and enforce security best practices.

---

## Regulatory Coverage
- **GDPR:** Automated detection of GDPR violations in code.
- **PII:** Detection of personally identifiable information (PII) in code.
- **Vulnerabilities:** Static analysis and (optionally) external vulnerability API integration.
- **Discrimination:** Automated detection of discriminatory patterns.
- **Dynamic Regulatory Rules:** Custom rules can be added, updated, and enforced via API.

---

## Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All compliance checks, rule changes, and sensitive actions are logged.
- **Tamper-Evidence:** Each log entry includes a cryptographic hash-chain for tamper detection (see below).
- **Retention Policy:** Logs are retained for at least 1 year (configurable).
- **Access Control:** Only authorized users (admin) can access audit logs.

---

## Tamper-Evident Audit Log (Implementation)
- Each audit log entry stores a SHA-256 hash of its content and the previous log's hash, forming a hash-chain (blockchain-like).
- Any modification to a log entry will break the chain and can be detected during audit.

---

## Compliance Readiness
- All code modules are documented with docstrings and comments.
- All compliance checks and audit features are covered by automated tests.
- OpenAPI documentation is customized for external review.
