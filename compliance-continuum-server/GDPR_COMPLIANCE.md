# GDPR Compliance Methodology â€” Compliance Continuum

This document outlines the concrete, automated technical controls enforced by this system to ensure GDPR compliance in code and process.

---

## 1. Automated Static Code Enforcement
- All code submitted for compliance checks is scanned for:
  - Presence of PII patterns (email, phone, address, SSN, etc.)
  - Absence of explicit user consent logic
  - Absence of encryption for PII
  - Absence of erasure/anonymization logic
- Any code handling PII **must** include:
  - Explicit consent logic (e.g., `user_consent`, `lawful_basis`)
  - Encryption routines (e.g., `encrypt`, `aes`, `rsa`, `crypto`)
  - Erasure/anonymization logic (e.g., `delete`, `erase`, `anonymize`)
- If any PII is found without all three above, the code is blocked and flagged as a GDPR violation unless it contains a `GDPR_SAFE` annotation.

## 2. Dynamic Rule & Policy Management
- Admins can add, update, or remove compliance rules (regex patterns) at any time via the `/regulatory/rules` API.
- Admins can add, update, or remove compliance policies (textual or structured) via the `/admin/policies` API.
- All rules and policies are enforced in real time with no restart or redeploy required.

### Example: Add a New Rule
```
POST /regulatory/rules
{
  "name": "No hardcoded passwords",
  "description": "Block any code with hardcoded passwords.",
  "pattern": "password",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Example: Remove a Rule
```
DELETE /regulatory/rules/{rule_id}
```

### Example: Add a Policy
```
POST /admin/policies
{
  "name": "Data Minimization",
  "description": "Only collect data that is strictly necessary for processing.",
  "content": "Data minimization is required for all processing operations.",
  "enabled": true
}
```

### Example: Remove a Policy
```
DELETE /admin/policies/{policy_id}
```

## 3. Audit Logging
- All compliance checks, code submissions, and violations are logged for traceability and auditability.

## 4. Alerting
- All GDPR violations are immediately logged as critical alerts in the system and can trigger notifications.

## 5. Policy Documentation
- Admins can define and update GDPR compliance policies via the `/admin/policies` endpoint for reference and reporting.

## 6. Manual & Legal Review (Recommended)
- For maximum assurance, regular manual code reviews and legal audits are recommended in addition to automated checks.

**Disclaimer:**
While this system enforces all known technical controls for GDPR compliance and blocks known violations, true GDPR compliance also requires organizational process, documentation, and legal review. No tool can guarantee 100% compliance in all real-world scenarios, but this system provides the strongest automated technical enforcement possible.
